# Data-Analysis-Project-On-Job-Training-and-Wage

It is common to believe that job training is efficient in boosting the earnings of disadvantaged workers. In
the 1970s, several experiments were conducted to explore the real impact of job training on wages, including
the National Supported Work (NSW) Demonstration[1]. In the experiment, eligible workers were assigned to
receive job training, and their incomes in 1973, 1974, and 1977 were recorded accordingly.

This primary goal of this analysis is to assess whether receiving job training has a significant effect on annual
earnings and what is the range of the impact. Other considerations include whether this effect differs by
demographic groups in terms of age, education, and racial identity. Weâ€™re also interested in exploring other
associations with wages.

Considering the effect of job training alone, the average odds of earning a non-zero pay for trained workers is
72% lower when compared to untrained workers. We are 90% confident that the actual decrease is contained
in the interval (7%, 92%). However, the effect of job training differs across ages. Compared to untrained
workers, workers who received training tend to have a 2.3% net increase in the odds of earning a non-zero
wage as their age increases by one-unit.

Besides treatment and age, Black is also an influential factor for predicting the probability of earning a
non-zero wage. Compared to White workers, the odds of earning a non-zero wage is 52.9% lower for Black
workers, keeping other variables constant.
