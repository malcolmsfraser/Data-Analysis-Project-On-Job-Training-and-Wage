# Data-Analysis-Project-On-Job-Training-and-Wage

It is common to believe that job training is efficient in boosting the earnings of disadvantaged workers. In
the 1970s, several experiments were conducted to explore the real impact of job training on wages, including
the National Supported Work (NSW) Demonstration[1]. In the experiment, eligible workers were assigned to
receive job training, and their incomes in 1973, 1974, and 1977 were recorded accordingly.
This primary goal of this analysis is to assess whether receiving job training has a significant effect on annual
earnings and what is the range of the impact. Other considerations include whether this effect differs by
demographic groups in terms of age, education, and racial identity. Weâ€™re also interested in exploring other
associations with wages.
